We did not rely on new struct, global of static variables here to implement
argument passing. However, we do design separate functions for the task,
they are in process.c:

/* push 4 bytes of data on top of stack at *p_stack, adding safety check
   to ensure the push does not overflow stack page */
static bool push_4byte (char** p_stack, void* val, void** esp);

/* separates the program file name from command line  */  
static void get_prog_file_name (const char* cmd_line, char* prog_file_name);

/* parse cmd_line, separate program file name and following arguments
   and push to stack exactly as illustrated in pintos document 3.5.1. */
static bool argument_passing (const char *cmd_line, void **esp);


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

To implement argument parsing, we first scan in reverse order (from right
to left) to find each argument within the input command line using pointer 
char *curr, and for each argument encountered, we push it on top of user stack
beginning from PHYS_BASE - 1; after successfully pushing all the arguments, we
insert word-alignment segement for better accessing speed; after that, we scan
the stack for the address of each argument, and push it on stack. The elements 
of argv[] is ensured to be in right order by push the arguments into stack in 
reverse order. 

We also implement method to avoid overflowing the stack page. Firstly, when we
push any argument to the the stack, we ensure that the argument length is not 
longer than available space; secondly, we add a utility function push_4byte to 
push argv addresses, argv, argc and fake return address to the top of user 
stack, and by performing boundary check to make sure each push does not 
overflow the stack page.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() typically uses a static pointer to store the states (the position in
the string). The static pointer is subjected to potential race conditions and 
is thus not thread-safe.

strtok_r() takes a third arguments to determine the place within the string 
to go on searching tokens. The space to store the states is offered by the 
caller, and thus works in a multi-threaded environment in Pintos.


>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

The first advantage of Unix approach is that it is much safer and simpler to 
use shell-based parsing operations. This way shell could help check any 
unsafe command line before they arrive at kernel directly, and thus reduce
the complexity of kernel operations.

In Unix-like systems, the separation between executable name and arguments 
enables more complex semantics such as redirection, pipelining in shell 
operations. With Pintos' approach, we would have to add a lot of code in 
kernel to achieve similar goals, and this violates the laying design principle
commonly used in computer system.

Moreover, combined with PATH environment variable, Unix-like shell gives more
flexibility in looking for executable files. Revolving pathname and looking 
for files tend to be expensive, and it is best left to external programs such 
as shell to finish the task as Unix-like systems did. With Pintos' approach,
the kernel would have to undertake the task to look for a file during the 
initialization of a process.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

In our implementation, each process maintains its own list of open files in 
an array of length 128. While the first 2 elements are intentionally left
NULL for STDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO, each subsequent array index is used
as a file descriptor corresponding to the open file stored in this array 
element.

When opening a file we search in the array to find a vacancy, store the 
pointer to file_info structure there, and return the index as file descriptor.
And when closing a file we can go directly according to file descriptor 
(index in array) to find the file_info structure and close it. This way, 
each process has an independent set of file descriptors, and the file 
descriptors are not inherited by child processes. In each process, current 
opened files has a unique id to distinguish from each other, which achieves 
the requirements of the project.

In our implementation, file descriptors are unique just within a single 
process. Different processes may have the same file descriptors.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Pintos uses virtual address for accessing of physical memory. In our design,
we take advantage of this fact and implement checking the validation of
user level memory before the system call actually performs execution. Given
any read or write file system call, first we check if the file descriptor is
valid, in the range of 2 to 127 or STDIN_FILENO/STDOUT_FILENO for
read()/write() respectively. For read(), if the file descriptor is 
STDIN_FILENO, we call input_getc() to read from stdin; while for write(), 
we call putbuf() when the STDOUT_FILENO is encountered.

For the next step, we check whether the address provided by user is valid.
For every page in the range of memory that can be reached from user supplied
address (e.g. from buffer to buffer + size in read() and write()), we first
verify a user virtual address is below PHYS_BASE, and then we verify that the
particular page is mapped. In doing so, we ensure the system calls all the
conditions required to perform the data transfer tasks. If there is any other
situation that will cause unexpected termination of the process, the page_fault
handler will take in position.

Finally we deal with the typical case where actual file I/O is requested. The
list of open files recorded in thread structure is queried to find the file
structure according to file descriptor. Then this file structure is used to
call file system methods file_read_at() or file_write_at() to finish the task.
Of course, all these file system calls are protected by a global lock to avoid
race conditions.

In our current implementation approach, if a system call causes a full page of
data to be copied, the greatest possible number of inspection could be 2, and 
the least number could be 1(if we are lucky enought), depending on whether the
data lies on two different pages. We use pagedir_get_page check each page once.
So when the data spans two pages, we will check twice, and if the data is 
within one page, we only check once.

When copying 2 bytes of data, the situation in is similar. The number of 
inspections depends largely on how many pages the data actually spans. But
ofcourse, the probability of checking two pages in this case is far lower than
the above case. 

A different approach is not to check the address for read and write, but let 
the operations continue until there is a pagefault occuring. Then we can 
implement handler to deal with the user pagefault situation properly. In this 
way, if the address is valid, then 0 inspection is needed. For the reading
of 2 bytes of data, which would happen much more frequently, significant amount
of time will be saved. And if an invalid span is attempted, the system would 
write data to the valid address until the invalid address appears. It is clear
that reading and writing data are much faster than calls to the time-consuming
pagedir_get_page for inspections. 


>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

To implement "wait" system call, we add struct process_info to record the
metadata of the process, such as a process's pid, whether the process is 
already waited by its parent process, whether a process's parent is alive,
whether the process is alive, and the exit status of the process.  

Whenever a "wait" system call is called, the function operates as explained
below:

First, current thread would search among his child list to find if there 
is one process of his child matches the given pid. If there is one, the child 
process's metadata is retrieved. 

Then we will examine if the parent process has already waited for the child,
by checking the already_waited member. If the parent has already waited 
once for the child, then it immediately returns -1 as required by the 
assignment. If the process has not been waited for this child before, then 
we set the already_waited information to true, preventing further waits in
the future.

Next, before actually waiting for the child, we first check whether the child 
is still alive by checking is_alive in process metadata, as it is perfectly 
normal for a wait system call to be executed when the child is already dead. 
This is important since an already dead child would not have the chance to 
wake up its parent process, which would lead to the parent to wait forever. 
Note that even though the child may already be dead, its child_info is not 
freed until both of the parent and child is dead, so we are still able to 
get the dead child's exit_status at this time. If the child is not already 
dead, then this is the time to put the parent to wait.

We implement this by sema_down the semaphore sema_wait child process's 
metadata process_info. By doing so, we ensured that each sema_up of the 
children process is paired with only its parent's sema_down, or without
its parent's sema_down in case the parent not waiting for this child 
process.

There are two shields in our program making sure that the system call
successfully deal with fail. The first one is the function checkvaddr
as mentioned in above questions. To avoid obscuring the primary function
of code by error handling, we ensured a proper work environment for each
of the calls before it actually starts to work. The error handling function is
summarized together into one function to eliminate the possible causes that
may induce fail. In this layer of shield, we focus on prevention before the
fail actually occurs, rather than to handle all the errors after it actually
happens. If we detect any insufficiency for the process to execute 
successfully, we will not start execution but kill the process with 
thread_exit. Another shield is the page_fault handler when a fail indeed 
occurs. This will rarely happen in our design, but if it indeed happens, it 
will also follow the thread_exit routine.

To ensure that all the temporarily allocated resources would be freed, we
implement all the free functions in process_exit, which is the only way for
a termination of a user process. To prevent memory leakage, we search through
each kind of sources a process may be related with, including its opened files,
dynamic allocated structs for wait, and the page directories. To free all these
different kinds of sources, we also implement functions like free_info, to
check whether the source is actually needed to be freed. In this method, we
could ensure that every source used before would be searched if it is ever
needed when the process exits.

For instance, whenever a memory accessing error happens in system call read,
(the error could either be detected by the checkvaddr address we imposed or a
page fault), the termination would go through thread_exit and then process_exit
for an user process. In either way of the above situations, we would first free
all the terminated process's file arrays to ensure that all the file it opened
is now freed. Second, we would free the executing file of the process, and make
sure the file is now allowed to be written. Next, we will search through the
structures we allocated for wait function. As we require both child and the 
parent are dead before freeing their resources, the termination of process 
does not necessarily induce the free of this struct. Neverthless,
we examined if the struct satisfies the condition to free, to prevent memory
leak. At the end of exit, we free the page directory. 


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

Basically we add two member variables to struct thread to ensure this. 
One is a bool variable child_load_success indicating the load()
success/failure. child_load_success is updated every time start_process() 
calls load(), and the parent process calling exec() can read it to get the 
information. The other is semaphore sema_load initialized with value 0, and 
by calling sema_down() in the parent process before reading the 
bool variable and calling sema_up() in the child process after load() 
completes, we can ensure the parent process returns only after the child 
process has finished load().


>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

In our implementation, for every process, we create a struct process_info to 
record the metadata information of the process, so even when the current 
process exits, its parent process is still able to retrieve its exit_status, 
pid, etc. Each thread has a pointer pointing to its metadata, and has a 
member to record the struct representing its parent thread.

Let's denote parent process for P and child process for C for simplicity.

For synchronization, we use a sema_wait semaphore, a member of C's metadata
"process_info", to ensure the synchronization. When P calls wait syscall, it
examines its child_list for the one that matches the pid provided, then it
examines whether the process has already been waited (indicated by 
already_wait, a member of C's metadata), or C has already terminated (indicated
by is_alive, a member of C's metadata struct). If former case is true, the 
wait function returns -1 immediately, and for the latter case, the wait
function returns C 's exit status (indicated by exit_status, a member of C's
metadata). If neither case is true, current process has to wait for C, so it
sema_down the sema_wait semaphore, a member of C's metadata, and wait for its 
child to wake it up. When C finishes executing and just before exit, it
sema_up the sema_wait semaphore in its metadata struct, no matter P actually
waits for it or not, because the C can only be waited by its unique parent
process.

The wait semaphore cannot be a member of P, because if this is the case, the
semaphore is shared between all its children processes. Since there is no way
for the child process at the time of exit to know if its parent is going to
wait for it or not (even P does not know, because you can't predit the 
future), it may falsely sema_up or not sema_up. For example, if C sema_up and
P doesn't actually wait for it, the sema-value is falsely increased by one,
causing P's next wait(sema_down) useless; on the other hand, if C does not 
sema_up and C actually waits for it some time in the future, then P will be 
blocked and perhaps never wake up again. 

The free of resources is tricky too. The process C's metadata struct should 
not be freed, because it should be preserved for inspection by its parent 
process(P). Then we have to ask its parent to free its resources when P exits,
but by then, some of P's children processes may be alive and the metadata can 
not be freed. This causes a dilemma. In order to avoid memory leakage, our
solution is as follows. Record the status of P and C in C's metadata
(parent_alive and is_alive) respectively. When P exits, it examines its 
child_list, and free all its dead children processes, and inform all the 
other living children that their parent is not alive; then P examines whether
its parent is alive, if not, it frees its own metadata, because metadata is
exclusively accessed by its parent, and when parent process exits, there is no
need to preserve the data. In this way, a process's metadata struct is freed
either by itself or its parent, depending who exits first.

Particularly, if P calls wait before C exits, then P will sema_down semaphore
sema_wait, and goes to sleep; when C finishes executing, C sema_up sema_wait
and do not free its metadata, because its parent is still alive (parent_alive
== true); then P wakes up, it continues executing, and at the time of exit,
it frees C's metadata, because by then C is a dead child process.

If P calls wait after C exits, then before C exits, it will sema_up and do
not free its metadata; the P then calls wait and sema_down, since the
semaphore is sema_up by C once, so sema_down does not put P to sleep, so P
will continue and at the time of exit, free C's metadata. Note in this case
and above case, whether or not to free P's metadata is depending on the
status of P's parent.

If P terminates without waiting, before C exits, then when P exits, it
informs C that it is dead; when C exits, it sema_up(though no use here), and
free its own metadata, because P is dead.

If P terminates without waiting, after C exits, then when C exits, it
sema_up, and when P exits, it frees C's metadata, as expected.  


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

To access user memory from the kernel, we write a function checkvaddr. First
check whether the virtual address is larger than PHYS_BASE, if it is, the 
checkvaddr function will return false. If the virtual address is below 
PHYS_BASE, we continue to use the pagedir_get_page to check if the virtual 
address has ever been mapped. If the system call requires a bulk of memory 
like the case in read and write, we check every page's mapping. 

We choose this way for its unity and simplicity. While it is true that using 
page_fault may result in faster speed, our function in checking virtual 
address is summarized all in a function. Whenever there is a need to use the 
virtual address, we could use this function.

Another advantage of this implementation is to prevent fault from actually 
happening. In each system call, we check the virtual address provided by the
user, if the address is not valid, the process would be terminated rather 
than allowing it to execute for a while. This may reduce the risk of 
potential resource waste. 


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

In our implementation, each process maintains its own list of open files in 
an array of length 128. While the first 2 elements are intentionally left
NULL for STDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO, each subsequent array index is used
as a file descriptor corresponding to the open file stored in this array 
element. When opening a file we search in the array to find a vacancy, store 
the pointer to file_info structure there, and return the index as file 
descriptor. And when closing a file we can go directly according to file 
descriptor (index in array) to find the file_info structure and close it.

The main advantages of our design for file descriptors lie in the overall
speed performance. Our implementation gives O(n) time complexity for 
allocating file descriptors when opening files, while O(1) time complexity 
for all subsequent query operations in any syscall involving file descriptors.

The disadvantages of our design could be that the number of open files 
allowed for each process is limited, or that when the number of open files is
small, it wastes memory space. We have considered these short-comings and
understood we can solve them by using dynamic structures such as list. It is
our choice to favor speed that we choose the design with array and file 
descriptor as index in the array.


>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We stick to the default implementation in mapping tid_t to pid_t. 
If tid_t is not mapped with pid_t, that will support a process running 
multiple threads, which is a feature not supported by Pinots. So we did not
change this part.
